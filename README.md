# About ExPerfWiz
ExPerfWiz is a PowerShell based module to help automate the collection of performance data on Exchange 2010, 2013, 2016 and 2019 servers.Â  Supported operating systems are Windows 2008, 2008 R2, 2012, 2012 R2, 2016 and 2019 Core and Standard.

# Recommended Install
Install the powershell module from the powershell gallery using `Install-Module ExPerfwiz` from the server where data will be gathered.

Additional information can be found on how to install powershell modules here:

# Manual Install
If the server where data is being gathered doesn't have access to the internet directly then either:

* Install the module to another machine in the org that does have access and use the -server switch
* Download the module from https://github.com/microsoft/ExPerfWiz/releases
  * Extract the Zip file to a known location
  * From powershell in the extracted path run `Import-Module experfwiz.psd1`
  * Change to a different directory than the one with the psd1 file

# Most Common Usage
`New-Experfwiz -folderpath C:\perfwiz -startoncreate`

# Example Usage

### Default usage for data gathering

  `New-ExPerfwiz -FolderPath C:\experfwiz -StartOnCreate`

### Stop Data Collection

  `Stop-ExPerfwiz`

### Collect data from another server

  `New-ExPerfwiz -FolderPath C:\experfwiz -server RemoteExchServer`

### Collect data from multiple servers

`Get-ExchangeServer | Foreach {New-Experfwiz -folderpath C:\experfwiz -startoncreate -Server $_.name}`

# Important Notes
* The default duration is 8 hours to save on disk space meaning that the data collection will stop after 8 hours.

* Using -Threads should only be done if needed to troubleshoot the issue.  It will SIGNIFICANTLY increase the size of the resulting perfmon files.

* Do not stop the log gathering thru the Perfmon GUI that can result in an unreadable log file.  Always stop the data gathering with Stop-Experfwiz.

* If there are any questions about using PowerShell Gallery please see: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/gallery/overview?view=powershell-7
